# Evaluating bias of static embeddings

## Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use it
- You can evaluate bias of static embeddings on [WEAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07187), [WAT](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1635/) and [SemBias](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1521/) with following command.
- If you want to evaluate your own embedding, change the embedding path in eval.sh.
``
./eval.sh
```
